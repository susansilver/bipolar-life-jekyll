That line haunts me. It comes from the song is &#8220;Transform.&#8221; Isabella Bunny Bennett, from the band <a href="https://steampoweredgiraffe.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://steampoweredgiraffe.com/">Steam Powered Giraffe</a>, wrote it about her trans experience.

That line strikes a chord with my heart.

&#8220;Am I naive for wanting something better.&#8221;

What Bunny does so well in this song is to send a message that we can understand. I feel this way as a queer person.

I remember what it was like before I came out. I never thought I could&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://susansilver.net/non-binary-characters/" rel="noreferrer noopener">live my life as a non-binary person</a>. It was just a dream for a while. I didn&#8217;t think people would understand or accept me that way.

Then one day, I attended a Gaymer convention. I thought this is my chance to try. So, yeah, I went to a meetup for non-binary people. It was at the convention. It was the first time I met people like me. I was so nervous. I don&#8217;t think that I came across the way that I wanted. But it is okay. What is most important was that after that experience that I wanted to be out so badly.

A small taste of freedom was all it took.

I&#8217;ve even started using my preferred name Suzza at work and in other places. It feels really good.
