My father re-married during the &#8217;90s. I was living with them in Los AngelesMy father re-married during the &#8217;90s. I was living with them in Los Angeles. Marrying my step-mom came with some baggage. Suddenly, I had a new uncle and aunt along with their children. Now my step-cousins. 

I had met the brother of my step-mom and his family. I got along with his daughter. So she spent the night at my house before the wedding.

We had the following conversation years later.

II explained to her that I was the gray sheep of my family. I was an overachiever who always got good grades in school. I was an underachiever because I never lived up to my full potential. I never became all the great things my family expected from me because of my promise.

She said to me, &#8220;you aren&#8217;t the gray sheep. You are a lime green sheep.&#8221;

What is a lime green sheep? Well, it is the sheep who is nothing like its family. That is what she had seen in me all those years ago. I don&#8217;t take after either parent. I am my own person. Because I was a latch key kid, I was left alone most of the time. I escaped through books, writing, and mathematics. I raised myself.

I am proud of myself and the person that I&#8217;ve become. My family doesn&#8217;t understand me. That is okay. I only ask of them that they accept me as I am. We&#8217;ve grown closer over the years and can now count them among my system of support. It wasn&#8217;t always that way.
